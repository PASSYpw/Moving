------------------------
I have moved from GitHub.com to GitLab.com, as Microsoft acquired GitHub on 4. June 2018. All projects listed under the account `Scrumplex` and under the organisation `PASSYpw` are read-only on GitHub and can now be accessed on their corresponding GitLab account.

This means, that I will not update any of my projects here. I will not commit code of my own projects on this platform, as long as it is owned by Microsoft. Only contributions to other projects will appear here (if any).
